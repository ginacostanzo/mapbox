- Before getting started coding up your Mapbox GL JS map, you'll need to include the relevant JavaScript and CSS files in your webpage. Mapbox provides hosted versions of each that you can include in the <head> of your HTML file:

```
<script src='https://api.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/v2.14.1/mapbox-gl.js'></script>
<link href='https://api.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/v2.14.1/mapbox-gl.css' rel='stylesheet' />
```
